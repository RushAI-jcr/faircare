# Release QA Audit — 2026-02-20

## Scope

Full repository QA pass for release readiness:
- Static checks (`ruff`, `mypy`)
- Full test suite (`pytest`)
- End-to-end synthetic workflow for API + CLI
- Output quality audit for HTML, PNG, and PPTX artifacts
- Governance export verification (CHAI XML + RAIC checklist JSON)

## Environment

- Date: 2026-02-20
- Python: 3.12.3
- Package install: `pip install -e ".[all]"`
- Playwright Chromium installed: `python -m playwright install chromium`

## Validation Results

### Static + Tests

- `python3 -m ruff check .` ✅ pass
- `python3 -m mypy src` ✅ pass
- `python3 -m pytest` ✅ pass (`1213 passed, 2 skipped`)

### End-to-End Workflow (Synthetic Data)

Artifacts generated under:
- `/tmp/faircareai_full_audit_20260220`

Generated and validated:
- Data scientist + governance HTML reports
- Data scientist + governance PDF reports
- Governance PPTX deck
- PNG bundles (`.zip`) for data scientist and governance personas
- JSON metrics export
- Governance model card markdown
- CHAI model card XML + JSON
- RAIC Checkpoint 1 JSON checklist
- Reproducibility bundle JSON

### Output Quality Audit

Automated visual audit artifact:
- `/tmp/faircareai_full_audit_20260220/visual_quality_audit.json`

Summary:
- HTML charts: no detected text overlaps, no fonts <12px, no edge clipping flags
- PNG bundles: no blank images, no edge-contact clipping flags
- PPTX decks: no text shape overlaps, no text runs <12pt, no out-of-bounds shapes

## Issue Fixed During Audit

### RAIC metadata source alignment

Updated RAIC checklist export to read metadata from packaged source catalog instead of hardcoded legacy links.

Changed:
- `src/faircareai/reports/raic_checklist.py`
- `tests/test_raic_checklist.py`
- `README.md`
- `docs/USAGE.md`

Outcome:
- `source_url` and `documentation_url` now align to official Checkpoint 1 PDF URL.
- Checklist retains full criteria export with auto-evaluable evidence where available.

## Release Readiness Decision

No blocking defects found in tested flows. Current state is suitable for release candidate packaging, with validated core functionality and output quality checks across supported report formats.
